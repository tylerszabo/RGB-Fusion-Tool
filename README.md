## Running

`RGBFusionTool` is a command line tool. For usage instructions run:

```
RGBFusionTool.exe --help
```

### Examples

Set all zones to red (50% brightness)

```
RGBFusionTool.exe --static=Red --brightness 50
```

Color cycle with 2 second transitions in zone 0

```
RGBFusionTool.exe --zone=0 --colorcycle=2
```

List zones

```
RGBFusionTool.exe --list
```

Set zones 0 through 3 to color cycle at different speeds (with verbose output)

```
RGBFusionTool.exe --verbose --zone=0 --cycle=32 --zone=1 --cycle=16 --zone=2 --cycle=8 --zone=3 --cycle=4
```

## Troubleshooting

- Verify you're using a supported [motherboard](https://www.gigabyte.com/mb/rgb/)
- Attempt running the tool in an elevated command prompt
- Ensure all Gigabyte SDK DLLs are present (see *Dependencies*)
- Power down the motherboard completely (such that the power supply is shut off or unplugged) and power isn't coming in through USB. Wait ~20 seconds for the board to discharge. (There's an issue where the controller can get stuck and only a complete power down seems to reset it.)
